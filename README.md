# Welcome to my first public repository
 
So far I've learned how to
1. Get setup with Git and Github
  1. Installing Git
  2. Signing up Github
2. Use the **command line**
3. Push code to a **repository**
4. Merge code using
  1. git merge
  2. Github's pull requests
5. Creating README files
 
[I learned all this from Code Institute!](http://codeinstitute.net)

NB: This repository is my first foray into coding. It's probably not pretty, or the most efficient - but we all have to start somewhere right?!
